# Welcome to the Opatz Lab ROSA toolbox

The toolbox is currently a work-in-progress. 
I'll start with a few basic functions, but hopefully more stuff will follow. An Example of the common excel-file used for meta-data storage is also provided.

In the folder [Wrappers](https://github.com/mchini/HanganuOpatzToolbox/tree/master/Wrappers) you can also find a few examples of "main scripts" that wrap around there functions.
Most of the scripts that are uploaded here should be commented enought to be readable/usable, but please let me know if something is unclear/should be better documented.
If you suspect to have found a mistake, please let me know ASAP!

If you wrote a function (or series of functions) that you think could be of general interest for the lab, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it to the toolbox. Just make sure that is commented and intelligible for everyone.
Similarly, if you would like some other (series of) functions in the toolbox, please let me know.

For the moment everything is quite experimental here, so it is still possible to encounter some (minor?) bugs here and there. This will (hopefully) get better with time.

The best way for you to take advantage of this repository would be to fork it! 
Here is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on GitHub.
I would advise you to make use of [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) in order not to have to go through the command line for everything.
