# Welcome to the Opatz Lab ROSA toolbox

The toolbox is currently a work-in-progress. 
I'll start with a few basic functions and a master script, but hopefully more sophisticated stuff will follow. 
If you wrote a function (or series of functions) that you think could be of general interest for the lab, please let me know and I'll be happy to add it to the toolbox.

For the moment everything is quite experimental here, but in the near future only tested and re-tested scripts will be in the main directory.

If you want to take inspiration from this scripts but customize them to better fit your needs, just fork the repository! 
Here is a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on GitHub.
I would advise you to make use of [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) in order not to have to go through the command line for everything.
